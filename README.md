# Customer-segmentation
This project is to develop an analytical model for Redstone Federal Credit Union (RFCU) that segments their customers into different categories based on their daily transaction data. The model will provide insights and recommendations to inform RFCU's decisions related to credit line management, marketing, and fraud detection.
